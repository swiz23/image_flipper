# Image Flipper
Created by Solomon Wiznitzer as a fun independent project to understand how neural networks work.

## Description
**Objective:** To create a neural network from scratch (just using Python and Numpy) to parse a directory of images and reorient them if they are not right-side up.

**Overview:** There were three parts to this project.
- *Coding a neural network* - This part focused on coding up the functions needed to implement a neural network - specifically forward propagation, computation of the loss function, backward propagation, and updating the weights and biases.
- *Tuning the neural network* - After creating the functions, the next agenda was to adjust the hyper-parameters (like learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of hidden units in each layer, and the type of activation functions for each layer) to obtain the best results.
- *Pre and post-processing of images* - This step involved preprocessing the input images to a standard size that could then be fed into the neural network. It also involved rotating the images in the output directory to the proper orientation based on the results from the neural network.

**System Info:** This package was tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 using Python 2.7.12.
